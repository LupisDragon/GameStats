I wrote this for fun to keep track of how I doing in multiplayer video games.

It can be used for virtually any multiplayer game, from 2-MAX (currently set to 64).<br>
If the game is 2 player, instead of typing in which place you scored, you can type 'w' or 'l' (case insensitive), instead of '1' or '2', respectively.
